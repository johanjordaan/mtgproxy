##Why...

I wanted a simple place where I could dump a deck list and get a PDF generated with 9x9 cards per A4 sheet for the provided decklist.

I could not find a simple enough website to do this so I create this project.

If you find it usefulle or have any reqiuests please let me know.

##Thanks
